# World-Weather-Website
Used an API for all country names and put them in a table, along with one of their cities.
When clicked, shows the JSON file telling us about the weather, temperature, humidity etc. related to the city clicked.
Not able to convert JSON file into readable format, something not working in my code.
Used CSS from different websites, could've easily done better.
